# poetry-pyinvoke-plugin

A plugin for poetry that allows you to invoke commands in your `tasks.py` file delegating to `pyinvoke`.

Heavily inspired by the work from `keattang` on the [poetry-exec-plugin](https://github.com/keattang/poetry-exec-plugin) project.

## Installation

Installation requires poetry 1.2.0+. To install this plugin run:

`pip install poetry-pyinvoke-plugin`

For other methods of installing plugins see the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins/#the-plugin-add-command).

## Publishing

To publish a new version,first bump the package version in `pyproject.toml` and commit your changes to the `main` branch (via pull request). Then in GitHub create a new release with the new version as the tag and name. You can use the handy auto release notes feature to populate the release description.
